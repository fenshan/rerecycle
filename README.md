# rerecycle

Rerecycle is a collaborative board game made in 48 hours during the Rapu Game Jam in Kouvola (September 2019).  
The authors of this game are:
* Arsi
* Roxanne
* [Fen Nicolás](https://github.com/fenshan/)

Play time: 15-20 minutes on first playthrough, then 20-30 on a second play.

### About: 
In this game, you trade, recycle, and reuse your way to victory.
You gather resources, manufacture products, and reuse old, broken materials.
Over time, un-recycled resources run out and are destroyed, and people who want products get restless.
It’s a race against time and nature to produce as many products as you can with reusable resources!
In the meantime, learn about the challenges of circular economy.

### What do you need to play:
* 'Rules of Rerecycle.pdf' file to learn how to play the game.  
* 'Discard piles.png' is the board of the game.  
* 'Cards' and 'Specialty Tokens' folders.  
You can print the board, cards and tokens in order to play. Or you can use them inside the Tabletop Simulator (as we did for testing the game).
