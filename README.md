# rerecycle

### Rerecycle is a collaborative board game made in 48 hours during the Rapu Game Jam in Kouvola (September 2019).

The authors of this game are:
* Arsi Liimatainen
* Roxanne
* [Fen Nicolás](https://github.com/fenshan/)

Play time: 15-20 minutes on first playthrough, then 20-30 on a second play.

### About: 
In this game, you trade, recycle, and reuse your way to victory.  
You gather resources, manufacture products, and reuse old, broken materials.  
Over time, un-recycled resources run out and are destroyed, and people who want products get restless.  
It’s a race against time and nature to produce as many products as you can with reusable resources!  
In the meantime, learn about the challenges of circular economy.  

### What do you need to play:
* [Rules of Rerecycle.pdf](Rules%20of%20Rerecycle.pdf) file to learn how to play the game.
* [Discard piles.png](Discard%20piles.png)  is the board of the game. 
* [Cards](Cards) and [Specialty Tokens](Specialty%20Tokens) folders.  

You can print the board, cards and tokens in order to play. Or you can use them inside the Tabletop Simulator (as we did for testing the game).
